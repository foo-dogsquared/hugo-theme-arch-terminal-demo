= Terminal Plus-Minus

This is a demo of the 
https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-terminal-plus-minus/[Hugo Terminal Plus-Minus theme]. 

It serves as a real-life example of using the theme. 
In this example, the theme is installed with `git clone` since 
I don't really want to make some changes (yet...).

(Maybe I'll customize it a bit further to get a closer real-life example.)

Be sure to take a look with the 
https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-terminal-plus-minus-demo/blob/master/config.toml[site config file] 
to get an idea. 
I've also made sure that the config is also well-commented. 

It contains some content files mostly testing the rendering of 
Markdown and Asciidoctor content. 

It also features https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] as a tool 
for deploying your Hugo site. 
Feel free to take a look and steal it as an example.
